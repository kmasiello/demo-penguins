title: Reticulate Example
---

An example of how to use [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) in RStudio Workbench. 

## Setup

Before running this notebook you should set a value for `RETICULATE_PYTHON` in your `.Renviron` file. You can check if it has been set by running the code below.

```{r}
Sys.getenv("RETICULATE_PYTHON")
```

## Run Python Code

Set up reticulate.

```{r}
library(reticulate)
library(dplyr)
```

Create a dataframe using Python

```{python}
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
  "x": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
  "y": [True, False, True, True, False, False, False, True]
})

df
```

Access the same data from R using the `py` variable ðŸ¤¯

```{r}
glimpse(py$df)
```

You can also add the object into your R environment.

```{r}
df <- py$df
df
```
